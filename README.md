## Abstract
This paper proposes and applies a Geographically Weighted Elastic Net Logistic Regression (GW-ENLR) model. It extends previous research that has suggested the notion of a localized elastic net, as an extension to a localized ridge regression or a localized lasso.  All such models have the objective to capture data relationships that vary across space, where this studyâ€™s elastic net extension allows for a robust local model selection component that also alleviates local collinearity. The paper applies GW-ENLR to two case studies: patterns of voting at the county level in the 2016 USA presidential election, specifically examining the spatial structure of socio-economic factors associated with voting for Trump; and a species presence-absence dataset linked to explanatory environmental and climatic factors at locations on regular grid covering mainland USA. GW-ENLR is used to construct predictive classification models for the two case studies and the results are compared with those from an a-spatial logistic regression, an a-spatial elastic net logistic regression and a geographically weighted logistic regression. In all cases, classification rates were improved under the new GW-ENLR model. Results are discussed in the context of predictor variable collinearity, model (predictor variable) selection and the relationship heterogeneities that are present in data.
